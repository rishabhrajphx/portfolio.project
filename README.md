# portfolio.project
A portfolio project with some animations using Vanilla JS. Nothing fancy.

I have added a decryption effect, and a smooth drag transition on some images. 

Key things learned: 
  1) EventListeners and their uses.
  2) creating relative position trackers.
  3) random characters generator from a list of given characters.
  4) use of some mathematical functions to perform JS operations.
  5) various css properties.
